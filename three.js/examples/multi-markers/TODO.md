- TODO put a smoother on sub-marker while learning ? as a way to remove noise ?

- do an apps which does something with it
  - a minecraft going from markers to markers

- add a-frame support
  - support for learning new area
  - support of multi-marker description

- do a post about multimarker
  - how to use them, 
  - workflow: learning then using
  - pro: larger area can be coverded by 

- what to do with the official multimarker support
  - make an example for it, and keep supporting it



# How to compute the result of the learning
- we got statistics on the position/orientation/scale between each marker seen simultaneously
- we want a transposition matrix relative to the origin markersControls

- step1 - build the transposition matrix relative the origin marker controls
  - store it in the userData
  - use similar format as local matrix
- step2 - generate the file
 


- LATER: how to get more robust statistics?
