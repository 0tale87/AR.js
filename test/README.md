# Automatic tests for AR.js


# Measure Performance Principles
- Measure stability - so 3d shakiness, if marker is stable and camera too
  - influence of blur, influence of noises
- Measure accuracy - substract between where it should be, versus where it is.
- Measure latency - time to process one frame
- Measure performance fps
