# v0.9.1-dev - Current

- Improved documentations

# v0.9.0 - Initial Release

I worked a lot on WebAR. But i recently reached [60fps on mobile phones](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/831333879810236421).
so i think WebAR is now ready to be released :)

I will keep the usual branch model

- stable release on master branch
- current release on dev branch
- features in progress on their own branch
