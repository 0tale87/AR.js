It is a polyfill for webvr API using artoolkit as positional tracker.
Thus you can use the power of WebAR without depending on any specific API.


```html
<!-- include artoolkit-webvr-polyfill.js -->
<script src="artoolkit-webvr-polyfill.js"></script>
```

## Please Help
- it currently depends on three.js for the maths
- It uses 3+ math classes Vector3/Quaternion/Matrix4...
- i would love it to be fully standalone but time is missing
- WebAR is currently a single personn effort and this is big complex code :)
- the contribution is simple and a pull request
- if anybody is considering contributing it, i would love to help and point at the code.
